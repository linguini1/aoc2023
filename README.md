# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to Advent of Code. This year I am attempting to solve them using Rust, which I have little
experience in besides completing the Rustlings exercises.

I am fascinated by Rust's memory safety implementations and powerful type system, and especially intrigued by its high
performance despite being a modern language with lots of nice extras (zero-cost abstractions that are _blazingly fast_).

I am starting late to the challenge because of final exams, but I always have fun with the AoC exercises.
